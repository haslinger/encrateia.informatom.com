Unfortunately, I can no longer submit Encrateia for Apple's Test Flight.
My MacBook Pro is no longer supported for OSX upgrades, so I don't get the
latest XCode version 13, which is now required for uploading new versions.

I already bought that particular MacBook just for Encrateia and I am not going
to spend a high 3 digit number of 4 digit number (Euros) to get another one just
for this particular purpose. Sorry iPhone users.

But Encrateia is open source. If you are willing to go through all the hassle
deploying it to the Apple Store, all the power to you!
