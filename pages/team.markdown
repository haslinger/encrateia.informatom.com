## Core team

Encrateia would not exist if it were not for these people (i.a.o.):

* [Dominic Helm](https://twitter.com/hellmue) - initiator of
  [3 Schweinehunde podcast](https://3-schweinehun.de)
* [Stefan Dillinger](https://raincastle.blog) - trainer of 3 Schweinehunde,
  scientific advisor, and beta tester, a.k.a. Steve
* [Stefan Haslinger](https://informatom.com) - Schweinehund and development

Schweinehund is german for one's shoulder devil. Literal translation is pig-dog.

## Credits

Developing software means sitting on the shoulders of giants. We use lots of
libraries, tools, languages; in short: other software and hardware we depend
on to be able to develop and improve Encrateia.

Sometimes people from other software projects help us directly, when we run
into issues using their libraries. Especially to me meantioned are:

* [Patrick Finkelstein](https://github.com/BirdyF) - developer of
  [strava_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/strava_flutter#-installing-tab-)
  library
* [Hüseyin Tokpınar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huseyin-tokpinar-20ab75a4/) -
  developer of [sqfEntity](https://pub.dev/packages/sqfentity)

Thank you so much!
