Encrateia would not exist if it were not for these people (i.a.o.):

* [Dominic Helm](https://twitter.com/hellmue) - initiator of
  [3 Schweinehunde podcast](https://3-schweinehun.de)
* [Patrick Finkelstein](https://github.com/BirdyF) - developer of
  [strava_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/strava_flutter#-installing-tab-)
  library
* [Stefan Dillinger](https://raincastle.blog) - trainer of 3 Schweinehunde,
  scientific advisor, and beta tester, a.k.a. Steve
* [Stefan Haslinger](https://informatom.com) - Schweinehund and development

Schweinehund is german for one's shoulder devil. Literal translation is pig-dog.
