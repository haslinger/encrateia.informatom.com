#### for the Mobile Application Encrateia

The encrateia Website is a standalone application. That means, that all data
is stored locally in a database on your mobile device.

That also means, when you uninstall the application all data on the device is
deleted and cannot be recreated.

From now on we use Strava in short for the company
[Strava Inc](http://www.strava.com/) and their web services.

## Is there data leaving the device?

The only data, that leaves the device are the Strava credentials.
They are sent, whenever you press the [Download from Strava]-Button:

* to the Strava API to first of all get a token from strava, to be able to get
  information, which activities you have done
* to log in to the Strava web site, to be able to download the .fit-files for
  your activities

We have no affiliation to Strava whatsoever.

## Is there a way to use the app without a Strava account?

Not yet, you can though create a dummy Strava account with no activities at
all and later on import all the activities by copying the corresponding
.fit-files in the apps documents directory. You have found the right direcory,
when you see a text file put_your_fit_files_here.txt in that directory.
