> (Greek ἐγκράτεια, "in power - from ἐν (en, “in”) + κράτος (krátos, “power”).  
> Enkrateia comes from the adjective enkratês (ἐγκρατής from ἐν (en, “in”) which
> means possession, power over something or someone else + κράτος (krátos,
> “power”)). It results in the meaning of power over yourself, power over your
> own passions and instincts, self-control and self-mastery.
